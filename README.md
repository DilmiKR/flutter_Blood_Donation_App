# flutter_Blood_Donation_App
The Blood Donation Camp App, developed with Flutter, connects donors with nearby blood donation events. It allows users to register, find nearby camps using Google Maps, and track their donation history. With real-time notifications and an easy-to-use interface, the app makes it simpler for users to contribute to life-saving blood donation drives.
